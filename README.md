# AppInventor-HTTP-GET-Request-Test

This simple project enable us to test http GET requests and the response recived. This is aimed to testing and debuging.

*Note:* There're 7 textboxes: the first is designed to be the domain of the server and the other 6 are divided into 2 groups of 3 in order to make it easier to write the subdirectory. This way, we can do 2 diferent requests with out changing the parametres.
